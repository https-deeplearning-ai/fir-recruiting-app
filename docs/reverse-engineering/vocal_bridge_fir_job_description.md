## About AI Fund

AI is the new electricity: Just as electricity transformed numerous industries starting 100 years ago, AI is now poised to do the same. AI Fund is an early stage venture firm founded by Dr. Andrew Ng in 2017. Our portfolio companies utilize AI technology and applications to improve processes and efficiency. The AI Fund team combines their experiences as AI pioneers, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, investors, and operators. We are backed by a $176 million-dollar fund from top-tier VC firms.

Together, let's build great companies that will move humanity forward.

## About the Portfolio Company

Voice is exploding as the next UX frontier, yet today's speech→LLM→speech pipelines force builders to choose between low latency and deep reasoning & agentic workflows. This solution fixes this problem. We're building the **neutral, plug-and-play voice layer** that lets any developer keep their own model, agentic workflows, and brand persona while still delivering **sub-400 ms, human-sounding conversations**. Our wedge is a realtime "pre-response" orchestrator that will expand into the default orchestration cloud for every agentic voice and video app.

## Co-building With An Industry Partner

This venture is launching in collaboration with **DeepLearning.AI**, the global upskilling and community platform founded by Andrew Ng. DLAI's 5-million-strong learner base and network of 50,000+ ML engineers provide unmatched distribution, design-partner access, and brand credibility with the very developers who will adopt this realtime voice SDK. Together, AI Fund and DLAI give our CEO a built-in pipeline of beta users, evangelists, and hiring leads.

## Why Partner With AI Fund

We've been there. We've founded and scaled successful companies ourselves, and we know that creating meaningful startups is really hard. Many entrepreneurs toil with ideas for years. Many spend time building something without the foresight of limiting factors that could have been easily dismissed upfront. Accomplished execs often teeter between a desire to start a company and creating something great versus taking a job that is less fulfilling. If only someone could help with taking the risk out of turning an idea into reality and accelerate the company building process, more people would be inspired to start a company.

Coming up with great ideas, sussing them out, assembling great teams, and helping raise capital is what we do. We shorten a process that can take years down to months. We make sure you are going after the right market, are fully validated, and are surrounded by great teammates. Lastly, we make sure you see the world through the lens of a data scientist and machine learning expert, which is the perspective any meaningful company in the future must have. But we also know that the process is not about us. It's about great founders and empowering them to do great things.

## What We Seek

We are looking for passionate entrepreneurs with first-hand knowledge of the problem we are looking to solve. It's not a mandate, but ideally, we want people with experience solving business problems and have a keen eye for anticipating business risks. You may have been:

- A **product manager** running a product or product line before
- An **engineer** who has been on the front lines of helping shape a company
- A **management consultant** who has experience in a particular vertical
- A **proven entrepreneur** who recognizes that the difference between success and failure is razor-thin, and you want every advantage you can get

Lastly, we want people who are **leaders**. We desire people who can hire great people, get others excited about their vision, raise capital, and make it all happen.
