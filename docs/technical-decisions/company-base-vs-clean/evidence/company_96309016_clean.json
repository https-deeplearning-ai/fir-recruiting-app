Simple as that. I learned more during my internship here than I did in two years of college, because I had room to try things, make mistakes, and fix them. Some days were tough. Most days, I couldn\u2019t wait to open the laptop.\n\u00a0\nWhen I faced an issue, I approached Akshiv K., and the bugs vanished. We\u2019d trace it line by line until it was fixed. Short chats with Mohit Rathod cleared a lot of career fog, and he even ran a mock interview on my project that pushed me in the best way. Amit Sur was always juggling ten things, yet he still managed to help, crack a joke, and suggest the right book at the right time. Shashank Kate explains things simply and cleanly, and I picked up real habits from him. Arun Singh is basically a one-man army and somehow always had time to steer my project when I needed direction. And Sanchita Channa brought the energy that lifts a room with jokes and fun topics.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m leaving happy, a little wiser, and very grateful. I\u2019ll miss this team. Thank you, Griphic.\n\n#Gratitude #Internship #Griphic #ThankYouTeam",

Simple as that. I learned more during my internship here than I did in two years of college, because I had room to try things, make mistakes, and fix them. Some days were tough. Most days, I couldn\u2019t wait to open the laptop.\n\u00a0\nWhen I faced an issue, I approached Akshiv K., and the bugs vanished. We\u2019d trace it line by line until it was fixed. Short chats with Mohit Rathod cleared a lot of career fog, and he even ran a mock interview on my project that pushed me in the best way. Amit Sur was always juggling ten things, yet he still managed to help, crack a joke, and suggest the right book at the right time. Shashank Kate explains things simply and cleanly, and I picked up real habits from him. Arun Singh is basically a one-man army and somehow always had time to steer my project when I needed direction. And Sanchita Channa brought the energy that lifts a room with jokes and fun topics.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m leaving happy, a little wiser, and very grateful. I\u2019ll miss this team. Thank you, Griphic.\n\n#Gratitude #Internship #Griphic #ThankYouTeam",
