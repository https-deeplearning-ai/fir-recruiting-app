Poor adoption, missed promises, and fundamentally an inability to build product for the new eon of AI, clinician-first value.\n\nIf an AI scribe leads with how much doctors love their product, its likely a great tool. If your AI scribe leads with integration, RCM, CDI or any \"back office\" value, its likely building with the heuristics that gave us the crappy clinician experience software of yesteryear.
