They were real connection points, built by employees who care deeply about belonging and honoring one another.\n\nWe didn\u2019t just celebrate\u2014we gathered. Fireside chats, social hours, shared meals, and honest conversations created space for connection and learning. Because understanding culture requires more than acknowledgment\u2014it requires showing up curious. That\u2019s it.\n\nFor Women\u2019s History Month, we asked women across GRAIL to share the lessons they\u2019d want to pass down from generations before them. Their words have been powerful reminders of the strength, resilience, and quiet wisdom carried in our stories.\n\nMy own lesson? You can be soft and powerful. Tender and bold.
