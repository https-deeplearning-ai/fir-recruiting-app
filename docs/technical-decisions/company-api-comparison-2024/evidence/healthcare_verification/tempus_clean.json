Our algorithm is based on #echocardiographic data. The results?\n\n\u26a0 Following implementation of our Echo-based, AI-driven clinical algorithm, both white and black patients saw an improvement in time to\u00a0care & management of their severe aortic stenosis or severe mitral regurgitation, the improvement being more significant in black patients.\n\nWant to hear more? Join us at the upcoming #EACVI conference in Barcelona in May 2023 to learn more during our presentation of our work.

Our algorithm is based on #echocardiographic data. The results?\n\n\u26a0 Following implementation of our Echo-based, AI-driven clinical algorithm, both white and black patients saw an improvement in time to\u00a0care & management of their severe aortic stenosis or severe mitral regurgitation, the improvement being more significant in black patients.\n\nWant to hear more?
