Simple as that. I learned more during my internship here than I did in two years of college, because I had room to try things, make mistakes, and fix them. Some days were tough. Most days, I couldn\u2019t wait to open the laptop.\n\u00a0\nWhen I faced an issue, I approached Akshiv K., and the bugs vanished. We\u2019d trace it line by line until it was fixed. Short chats with Mohit Rathod cleared a lot of career fog, and he even ran a mock interview on my project that pushed me in the best way. Amit Sur was always juggling ten things, yet he still managed to help, crack a joke, and suggest the right book at the right time. Shashank Kate explains things simply and cleanly, and I picked up real habits from him. Arun Singh is basically a one-man army and somehow always had time to steer my project when I needed direction. And Sanchita Channa brought the energy that lifts a room with jokes and fun topics.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m leaving happy, a little wiser, and very grateful. I\u2019ll miss this team. Thank you, Griphic.\n\n#Gratitude #Internship #Griphic #ThankYouTeam",

Simple as that. I learned more during my internship here than I did in two years of college, because I had room to try things, make mistakes, and fix them. Some days were tough. Most days, I couldn\u2019t wait to open the laptop.\n\u00a0\nWhen I faced an issue, I approached Akshiv K., and the bugs vanished. We\u2019d trace it line by line until it was fixed. Short chats with Mohit Rathod cleared a lot of career fog, and he even ran a mock interview on my project that pushed me in the best way. Amit Sur was always juggling ten things, yet he still managed to help, crack a joke, and suggest the right book at the right time. Shashank Kate explains things simply and cleanly, and I picked up real habits from him. Arun Singh is basically a one-man army and somehow always had time to steer my project when I needed direction. And Sanchita Channa brought the energy that lifts a room with jokes and fun topics.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m leaving happy, a little wiser, and very grateful. I\u2019ll miss this team. Thank you, Griphic.\n\n#Gratitude #Internship #Griphic #ThankYouTeam",

This first-hand experience has helped us validate whatever works, identify what doesn\u2019t, and shape the product with the insight we gain.\n\u00a0\nAs we grew, we\u2019ve had the opportunity to attend industry events, receive recognition through awards, and even get featured in a few publications, all of which reinforced that we\u2019re on the right track to tackling a core challenge.\nBuilding a startup is not glamorous by any means. The last few months reminded us that steady progress, even behind the scenes, matters more than loud milestones.\nTo the team that brings this vision to life every day, thank you!\nTo everyone who\u2019s offered guidance, encouragement, and tough love, we\u2019re grateful!\nWe're getting ready to open up Cerebrus for everyone. The public launch is around the corner, and we\u2019re looking forward to showing you what we've built in its full glory.\nIf you're venturing into HR tech, thinking about better ways to hire, or just curious about what we\u2019re up to, let\u2019s connect!\n\n#FoundersJourney #VisionToReality #Griphic #LetsConnect #Cerebrus #TeamGriphic #2025SoFar #GriphicJourney",
