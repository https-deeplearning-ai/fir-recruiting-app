Vincent is a dedicated farmer who exemplifies what Zambro can achieve!\nVincent started with a robust flock of 680 Zambro birds. After managing his flock, he now has a strong base of 550 birds, with over 400 being females! He has decided to raise his Zambro\u2019s for egg production and he plans to ensure he reaches his target number of laying hens.\n\nMr. Musonda shared his ambitious goal, to become the major producer of local eggs for his community! He is already on his way, consistently supplying fresh Zambro eggs to the community directly through his thriving Home Shop. Currently, he collects an average of 2.5 trays per week, and he's expecting these numbers to climb even higher in the coming days as his younger hens mature.\n\nVincent highlighted the support and technical assistance he receives from Hybrid Poultry Farm. It's stories like Vincent's that truly inspire us and affirm our mission to empower farmers and build sustainable livelihoods. #ZambroSuccess #FarmerSpotlight #Petauke #EggProduction #PoultryFarming #HybridPoultryFarm",

Her good poultry management paid off, with an impressive minimal mortality rate \u2013 losing only 2 chicks during the crucial first week of brooding. This speaks volumes about her management skills and the robustness of the Zambro breed!\n\n\u00a0Her flock has already achieved an incredible average body weight of 2.5 kgs at 10 weeks, surpassing expectations! Carol has already secured a market for her entire flock in Lusaka! This pre-secured demand highlights the strong market appeal of Zambro birds for both meat and eggs.\n\nInspired by her success, Carol is now planning to place her next order for more Zambro chicks next week, ready to expand her flourishing poultry business. Her story is a testament to the profitability and efficiency Zambro brings to our farmers. #ZambroSuccess #FarmerSpotlight #Petauke\u00a0#GrowthForProfit #HybridPoultryFarm",

A client from Lusaka acquired 50 one-month-old teen birds from Mrs. Muchiya, one of our dedicated brooder unit farmers in Chongwe.\n\nMrs. Muchiya, currently managing a flock of 1,000 birds, demonstrates consistent growth and efficiency. This recent sale marks her sixth cycle of Zambro teen birds, following a purchase of 500 chicks just last week. Her commitment to maintaining a continuous supply of quality dual purpose birds is inspiring.\n\nIt's truly wonderful to see such proactive poultry farming under the APMI project, ensuring a steady supply for consumers across the region. #Zambro #ChongweFarmers #HybridPoultryFarm #ValueChain #DualPurposeChicken",

A client from Lusaka acquired 50 one-month-old teen birds from Mrs. Muchiya, one of our dedicated brooder unit farmers in Chongwe.\n\nMrs. Muchiya, currently managing a flock of 1,000 birds, demonstrates consistent growth and efficiency. This recent sale marks her sixth cycle of Zambro teen birds, following a purchase of 500 chicks just last week. Her commitment to maintaining a continuous supply of quality dual purpose birds is inspiring.\n\nIt's truly wonderful to see such proactive poultry farming under the APMI project, ensuring a steady supply for consumers across the region. #Zambro #ChongweFarmers #HybridPoultryFarm #ValueChain #DualPurposeChicken",

        "description": "A Visit to Ferme Tambo: Building Poultry Dreams in Lubumbashi \n\nJust 45 km from the bustling town of Lubumbashi, we visited Ferme Tambo, a farm with big dreams and plenty of potential. With 12 poultry houses on-site and a vision to reach full capacity, the farm is gearing up to transform its poultry production.\n\n Our Technical Support team member Martin made the following observations:\n\n\u2022\tManagement: Batch 1 started with 2,040 chicks, after assessing the flock in the first week, we advised scaling back to the observed capacity of 1,500 for better management.\n\u2022\tFeeders: Immediate action is needed to reduce feed spillage\u2014new feeders will make a huge difference!\n\u2022\tVentilation: Proper airflow is key for healthy growth and disease prevention. \n\u2022\tBiosecurity: With different age groups on the farm, strict biosecurity measures are critical to keeping diseases at bay.\n\nThe farmer was delighted with our insights and is now ready to place another 2,000 chicks! At Hybrid, we\u2019re here to support farmers like Mr. Tambo at every step--helping them grow for profit!\n\nHere\u2019s to building poultry success, one farm at a time! #HybridPoultryFarm #GrowForProfit #TechnicalSupport #PoultryFarming #Biosecurity #Lubumbashi",
