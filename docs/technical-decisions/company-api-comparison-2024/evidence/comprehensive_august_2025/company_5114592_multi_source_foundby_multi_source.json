It\u2019s going to be loud.\u201d\n\nWe said yes.\n\nLia launched into the most beautiful, robust song, her voice filling the Littles\u2019 north arena, which, it turns out, has incredible acoustics! Instantly, all 14 of the animals \u2014 goats, sheep, minis, donkey, and mule \u2014 turned toward her in still, rapt attention.

When she is at the farm, Erin looks forward to riding her horse, Kay, outside on nice weather days. Trotting is her favorite as Erin has a definite need for speed!\n\nRight now, Erin is working toward a big goal: holding the reins to steer and stop Kay on her own. It's not always easy though. Keeping her posture straight while managing the reins can be challenging and, at times, frustrating. But Erin\u2019s determination does not waver. In fact, her proudest moments are when she accomplishes things all by herself! Her instructor Mikki shared:\n\n\"Erin always gives her best when she shows up to ride! You can really see her dedication to riding and she always pushes herself to grow. She also has a big heart and always asks how everyone is doing, who someone new is, and where a team member is if they aren't there that day. She also knows every Disney song and will proudly sing the best lines when we play music in class! It's an honor to teach and learn from Erin and her class is always a bright part of the day!\"\n\nWhen she is not at the farm, you might find Erin enjoying one of her favorite hobbies, bowling! She also scuba dives and is an excellent swimmer. But above all, there is one thing Erin wishes everyone knew about her: she can be really silly!\n\nWhether she is reaching her goals in the arena or zooming around in her orange power chair, Erin is a joyful reminder that determination can help us overcome even the toughest challenges, while still being silly along the way.\nLearn more about Erin, and see her, for her at: https://lnkd.in/gJB3JxxF",

Lia, ever thoughtful and self-aware, acknowledged that her natural calm presence can be hard to shift. \n\nThen she asked, \u201cCan I try something? It\u2019s going to be loud.\u201d\n\nWe said yes.\n\nLia launched into the most beautiful, robust song, her voice filling the Littles\u2019 north arena, which, it turns out, has incredible acoustics! Instantly, all 14 of the animals \u2014 goats, sheep, minis, donkey, and mule \u2014 turned toward her in still, rapt attention. Ollie the goat even rested his head gently on Jerry the sheep\u2019s shoulder, completely absorbed in the music.\n\nIt was one of those rare, magical moments of pure connection and calm. \ud83d\udc9a \n\n#HeartwarmingMoments #MusicMagic",

But above all, there is one thing Erin wishes everyone knew about her: she can be really silly!\n\nWhether she is reaching her goals in the arena or zooming around in her orange power chair, Erin is a joyful reminder that determination can help us overcome even the toughest challenges, while still being silly along the way.\nLearn more about Erin, and see her, for her at: https://lnkd.in/gJB3JxxF",

Now at 44, she continues to ride in our Adaptive Riding program, with the same joy and determination.\nOver the past year, she has made big strides in strength and communication, even returning to trotting again during her lessons. Her instructor Haley shared:\n\n\u201cI have loved watching Leah get stronger over the past year! She is strong enough to stay centered and balanced enough that we have been able to trot again during lessons! Leah has also been talking more, letting the leader know the color of the next pole or cone and even letting us know who is singing next in The Lion King! I'm excited that the weather is getting nice again, because she loves to ride outside and steer Harry over the tracks!\"\n\nDespite the frustration of not always being able to express herself verbally, it is the kindness and love that Leah receives that keeps her moving to new heights. Like her favorite Disney princesses, Leah carries a magic all her own - a spirit that speaks louder than words ever could.\n\nLearn more about Leah, and see her, for her at: https://lnkd.in/deHYFJQA",

Now at 44, she continues to ride in our Adaptive Riding program, with the same joy and determination.\nOver the past year, she has made big strides in strength and communication, even returning to trotting again during her lessons. Her instructor Haley shared:\n\n\u201cI have loved watching Leah get stronger over the past year! She is strong enough to stay centered and balanced enough that we have been able to trot again during lessons! Leah has also been talking more, letting the leader know the color of the next pole or cone and even letting us know who is singing next in The Lion King! I'm excited that the weather is getting nice again, because she loves to ride outside and steer Harry over the tracks!\"\n\nDespite the frustration of not always being able to express herself verbally, it is the kindness and love that Leah receives that keeps her moving to new heights. Like her favorite Disney princesses, Leah carries a magic all her own - a spirit that speaks louder than words ever could.\n\nLearn more about Leah, and see her, for her at: https://lnkd.in/deHYFJQA",

        "description": "At Main Stay, we understand the vital role that hoof care plays in the overall health and well-being of our incredible herd of horses. As part of International Hoof Care Week (January 21-24, 2025), we\u2019re excited to share insights into how we approach hoof care and the thoughtful considerations that go into every decision we make for our herd!\n\nRegular farrier care is crucial for horses, whether they are barefoot or a shod horse but how do we decide whether a horse will wear shoes or not? \n\nThe decision to shoe a horse or keep them barefoot depends on various factors like their environment, job, and conformation. We work with our team of farriers and veterinarian to consider the following for every horse at Main Stay:\n\n- Hoof structure and angles\n- Physical body structure\n- Sensitivities and comfort level\n- Previous history\n- Xray diagnostics\n\nOur goal for our horses is to maintain a primarily barefoot herd due to the ability for more natural movement and the natural shock absorption properties, which in turn reduces joint strain in our horses, increasing the longevity of our working animals.\n\nOften many of our incoming new horses may transition to barefoot. This can take approximately one month per year of previous shoeing, to create gradual changes. Even after transition barefoot horses still require regular farrier care to maintain healthy hooves. Our consistent schedule of every 6-8 weeks ensures proper balance, prevents overgrowth, and reduces the risk of potential injury. \n\nAsher is a great example of the trial and error that comes with hoof care.

        "description": "At Main Stay, we understand the vital role that hoof care plays in the overall health and well-being of our incredible herd of horses. As part of International Hoof Care Week (January 21-24, 2025), we\u2019re excited to share insights into how we approach hoof care and the thoughtful considerations that go into every decision we make for our herd!\n\nRegular farrier care is crucial for horses, whether they are barefoot or a shod horse but how do we decide whether a horse will wear shoes or not? \n\nThe decision to shoe a horse or keep them barefoot depends on various factors like their environment, job, and conformation. We work with our team of farriers and veterinarian to consider the following for every horse at Main Stay:\n\n- Hoof structure and angles\n- Physical body structure\n- Sensitivities and comfort level\n- Previous history\n- Xray diagnostics\n\nOur goal for our horses is to maintain a primarily barefoot herd due to the ability for more natural movement and the natural shock absorption properties, which in turn reduces joint strain in our horses, increasing the longevity of our working animals.\n\nOften many of our incoming new horses may transition to barefoot. This can take approximately one month per year of previous shoeing, to create gradual changes. Even after transition barefoot horses still require regular farrier care to maintain healthy hooves. Our consistent schedule of every 6-8 weeks ensures proper balance, prevents overgrowth, and reduces the risk of potential injury. \n\nAsher is a great example of the trial and error that comes with hoof care. Asher came to us in shoes and while we tried to transition him to barefoot he made it clear to us he was more interested in the support the shoes he was used to offered him. \n\nFor the short time he was barefoot we provided him additional protection through the use of HoofArmor. HoofArmor is a two-part epoxy that cures to the bottom of the hoof and is strong enough to stand up to abrasive surfaces and chipping but remain flexible enough to flex with the natural hoof movement and expansion. Additionally, we supplement his diet with NuHoof, which adds essential amino acids and biotin to his diet to provide even further support in his hoof health.\n\nUltimately, there\u2019s NO one-size-fits-all answer.

All of these beings share a connection between each other \u2013 the horse is connected to the leader through the lead rope, and the side walkers are connected to the rider by physical touch. But what is very special about this photo is that it shows a connection that goes beyond the boundaries of physical connection! The side walkers, the horse, and the leaders are all walking in unison. \n\nThis moment is really special because it illustrates the essence of adaptive riding: a unified effort, enabling the rider to receive what they need from the lesson without even needing the direction of when to pick up their feet. It truly shows the transformative power of adaptive riding, where teamwork forms the backbone of a shared, uplifting experience.\n\nAs we kick off the first day of the winter adaptive riding session, we celebrate the connections and teamwork that make these lessons so special.

The breed originates from Switzerland and is used as dairy goats. They were introduced to the United States in the early 1900s.\n\nJasmin loves to socialize with all of the herd and is accepting of everyone! She is a healthy eater who loves mealtimes, and she gets fed extra because of her age. Jasmin started her career of helping children by being a 4H goat, but because of a physical condition she is not the ideal for a dairy goat and would likely have ended up as a meat goat instead. Fortunately, an equine & animal assisted learning client was at the county fair, met Jasmin, and that special connection led her to Main Stay. She arrived at the farm in the backseat of the farm truck and fit right in with the herd! She can be found chewing her cud, enjoying her naps, and spending time with the other animals!",
