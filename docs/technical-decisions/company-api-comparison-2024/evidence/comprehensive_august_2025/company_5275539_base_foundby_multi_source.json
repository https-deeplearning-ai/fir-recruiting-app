The head nurse caring for him, a long-time colleague and friend, reached out to me as a courtesy.\n\n\u201cBen, I\u2019m calling about one of your patients,\u201d the nurse began. \u201cActually, it\u2019s about the mother.\u201d\n\nI had cared for this child and his siblings for at least a dozen years as a primary care physician. I knew the mother well, and I knew how loving, supportive, and capable she was of caring for her son.\n\n\u201cThe hospital team is becoming increasingly concerned,\u201d the nurse continued. \u201cThey\u2019re saying she doesn\u2019t seem to be emotionally impacted by the state of her son\u2019s condition. She\u2019s not showing up to the hospital until the evening, and she\u2019s missing meetings with the care team. They\u2019re questioning if she understands how serious his condition is.\u201d She paused, \u201cThey want to know if there is something about the mother\u2019s intellectual development or mental health needs that we should know about.\u201d\n\nThe way she was describing this woman was a complete disconnect for me; it was a person I didn\u2019t recognize. During my years spent caring for this family, we joked together and shared recipes. The mother talked emotionally about her sick son and with great passion about the love she had for her family. She knew her son\u2019s health care needs better than me. She could easily tell the nuances of a bad or good day for her child well before they showed up clinically for us on the care team.\n\nRead more:\n\nhttp://ow.ly/nqOJ50MB4N5",

        "description": "\"'I learn differently.' Three small words that can make a big difference for kids with learning issues. Sounds simple, right? Wrong.\n\nWhen kids are struggling, speaking up can feel scary. To outsiders, the symptoms of learning issues can look like laziness or acting out. And kids who need help often end up in trouble instead. Helping kids talk about their learning differences can help. But many kids may feel embarrassed or ashamed of not being able to learn the way other kids do. Or just not know where to start or what to say.\n\nYou can model speaking up by talking with your child, and to others, about learning differences openly. Help kids get comfortable by talking through any questions, worries or fears they have. Then work together to come up with some conversation starters they can use: \u201cSometimes I look like I\u2019m not paying attention, but\u2026\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s good to help kids get comfortable saying the name of their learning difference \u2014 for example, \u201cI have dyslexia\u201d or \u201cI have auditory processing disorder\u201d\u2014 so there is no confusion. Not all kids with learning issues are the same.\n\nHelp your child to understand and share how their learning difference impacts them. For example, \u201cWhen there\u2019s background noise I can\u2019t hear the teacher.\u201d If your child has habits or strategies that help them manage their learning difference, encourage them to let the teacher know. For example, \u201cDrawing helps me pay attention.\u201d\n\nEncourage your child to share their strengths as well as their struggles. Talking about, and participating in, things they\u2019re good at will boost self-esteem.\"\n\nRead more:\nhttp://ow.ly/L2Pu50Mzby6",

        "description": "Most kinds of anxiety focus on a particular worry \u2014 fear of heights, separating from parents, speaking in public, things like germs or spiders.  But some kids are anxious about many things. They have what\u2019s called generalized anxiety disorder or GAD.\n\nKids with GAD worry about everything, and it often takes the form of \u201cwhat ifs\u201d:\n\n\u201cWhat if we run out of gas?\n\n\u201cWhat if mom loses her job?\n\n\u201cWhat if a hurricane blows away our house?\n\n\u201cWhat if I get a bad grade?\u201d\n\nKids with GAD tend to imagine the worst happening, and  their anxiety may not be triggered by anything in particular. They may be irritable and have trouble sleeping.\n\nKids with GAD also tend to be perfectionists. They may put enormous pressure on themselves to perform well \u2014 more than their teachers or parents \u2014 and may avoid doing things because they\u2019re worried about not doing them well enough. They may have anxious stomachaches and headaches and spend a lot of time in the school nurse\u2019s office.\n\nIt\u2019s important to get help for kids with GAD because all that worry can lead to depression, and it also leads, for teenagers, to substance use \u2014drinking alcohol or smoking pot to ease their anxiety.\n\nTreatment for GAD includes cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), in which kids learn to recognize irrational thinking and replacing it with more logical, healthy ways of thinking. An alternative is acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), which teaches kids to acknowledge and accept the anxious thoughts they\u2019re having and commit to moving forward despite them. Parents also learn how to avoid enabling their child\u2019s anxiety and instead support their overcoming it.\n\nSevere GAD may be treated with a combination of therapy and medication, usually an antidepressant called an SSRI.\n\nhttp://ow.ly/Jf8g50MylX4",

She\u2019s not showing up to the hospital until the evening, and she\u2019s missing meetings with the care team. They\u2019re questioning if she understands how serious his condition is.\u201d She paused, \u201cThey want to know if there is something about the mother\u2019s intellectual development or mental health needs that we should know about.\u201d\n\nThe way she was describing this woman was a complete disconnect for me; it was a person I didn\u2019t recognize. During my years spent caring for this family, we joked together and shared recipes. The mother talked emotionally about her sick son and with great passion about the love she had for her family. She knew her son\u2019s health care needs better than me. She could easily tell the nuances of a bad or good day for her child well before they showed up clinically for us on the care team.\n\nRead more:\n\nhttp://ow.ly/nqOJ50MB4N5",

        "description": "CNN \u2014 A cocktail party on Capitol Hill is often hardly notable.\n\nBut at one recent soiree, the clinking of glasses had a different ring. Members of both parties joined together to kick off a renewed effort to solve a uniquely American problem: no universal paid family and medical leave.\n\nIt\u2019s been 30 years since the Family and Medical Leave Act became law. It guaranteed workers the right to unpaid, job-protected time off.\n\nBut the United States is one of only seven countries in the world without some form of universal paid family and medical leave.\n\nA bipartisan congressional duo is trying to change that.\n\n\u201cWe live in the greatest nation in the world, and we do so many things well, but when you\u2019re talking about families, this is one area that we have struggled,\u201d Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma told CNN during an interview in her Capitol Hill office last month.\n\nSitting beside her, nodding, was Democratic Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frankly an embarrassment that we are one of the seven nations or so that doesn\u2019t have this kind of focus on the family,\u201d Houlahan said. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really important that we lead by our example.\u201d\n\nAt the end of January, determined to find a solution to the lack of universal paid family and medical leave in America, the congresswomen officially launched their House Bipartisan Paid Family Leave Working Group.\n\n\u201cWe are action-oriented, and we are committed to having open eyes and ears,\u201d Houlahan said, addressing policy advocates and politicians alongside Bice at the group\u2019s launch party.\n\nTheir task force is composed of six House members: three from each party, including Democrats Colin Allred of Texas and Haley Stevens of Michigan and Republicans Julia Letlow of Louisiana and Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa. Such a partnership across the aisle, Bice insisted, is not that uncommon.\n\n\u201cMore of that happens than people realize back home,\u201d the Oklahoma Republican told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of bipartisanship that goes on behind the scenes, trying to bring everyone together and move the country forward. And this is one way we\u2019re doing that.\u201d\n\nRead more:\nhttps://lnkd.in/gXYhQsjj",

        "description": "We teach teenagers that before any sexual activity they should make sure they have the other person\u2019s consent. They need to say they agree, not just act like they\u2019re interested. That sounds simple, but many teenagers find it awkward to ask for consent. And it can also be difficult to respond, especially if you want to say \u201cno.\u201d\n\nOne reason to teach kids to ask for consent is that sometimes they are so focused on what they want that they don\u2019t think about the other person\u2019s feelings. Teenagers are naturally self-centered. They may think that applying pressure is an appropriate way to get what they want.\n\nIt\u2019s important for parents to tell kids it\u2019s not okay to pressure someone into going farther than they are ready for. And no one should feel they need to give in to pressure, either from a partner or from friends, to have sex if they\u2019re not ready.\n\nIt\u2019s important for teenagers to know that if someone flirted with you or wore a sexy outfit, that doesn\u2019t mean they consented to have sex. And not telling you to stop is not the same as giving consent.\n\nBecause a lot of bad sexual encounters happen when one or both people are drunk, it\u2019s also important for kids to know that someone who is drunk or high can\u2019t give consent. And if you see someone who is drunk being pushed to have sex, do what you can to safely help them escape. \n\nBoys may have gotten the idea that women like it when a confident man pushes past their resistance. It\u2019s especially important to tell boys that it\u2019s not cool or powerful, it\u2019s creepy and dangerous. Don\u2019t mince words. Talk frankly with your son about the emotional, personal, social and legal consequences of sexual misconduct.\n\nRead more from the Child Mind Institute:\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dVXiTQU\n\n#TeenDVMonth",

        "description": "Black girls and women face disproportionately adverse sexual and reproductive health outcomes resulting from a history of systemic racism and reproductive oppression that has denied them bodily autonomy, access to high-quality health care, and social and economic equality. Black girls and women are more likely to experience unintended pregnancies, die of pregnancy-related complications, face higher rates of infant mortality, and endure heightened levels of parenting stress as their children grow older amid concerns about their well-being and survival. However, solutions that incorporate principles of the reproductive justice framework\u2014which asserts that human rights include the right to have a child (or not have a child) and the right to parent one\u2019s child in safe, sustainable communities\u2014can mitigate the influence of reproductive oppression and promote Black girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sexual and reproductive health and the well-being of their families.\n\nBelow, we offer five strategies for policymakers and practitioners, based on the principles of the reproductive justice framework. Elements of these five strategies and other efforts to apply the framework are underway across the country, especially in communities of color. Collectively, they hold promise for improving the sexual and reproductive health of Black girls and women, and for all birthing people.\n\nRead more:\n\nhttp://ow.ly/vQQs50MHeRQ",

This series will allow for participants to experience a different self-care or renewal activities at no cost. It's our way of \"walking the talk\" for those we support and to demonstrate that we are thankful to serve those who serve our community.\n\nJoin us March 1 from 10am-noon at MCCOY for Vision Boards, our first Me Time with MCCOY Session:\n\nNow that 2023 is rolling, let\u2019s set yourself up to claim the incredible year ahead!  During this session we encourage you to hone in on 2023 goals, like what you want to accomplish, are ready to let go of, want to spend more time doing, and/or how you want to feel. You\u2019ll select what visual representations, stickers, motivational quotes or affirmations to include on your vision board to tell the story of who you will become and what your life will look like when your vision becomes a reality. You\u2019re welcome to bring anything (photos, quotes, etc.) that you\u2019d like to add to your board. We\u2019ll bring the rest of the supplies!\nNew to vision boards? Vision boards are usually created for short term goals, long term goals, month by month, year by year, or even one representing your life 10 years from now. As long as you have dreams and goals, you can always have vision boards.\nTo be led by Jamie Scott, Edna Martin Christian Center",

Nine other people between the ages of 16 and 21 were injured at the party, and the more than 100 people who were present are forever affected. Our entire community is also profoundly impacted by this tragic incident.\nIn response, the Marion County Youth Violence Prevention Coalition joined forces with a number of churches and organizations to tell lawmakers to take action.\nWe are looking for businesses, organizations, and individuals to sign onto a joint letter to tell Indiana lawmakers to support common-sense gun safety policies!\nMCCOY has signed on to this letter, lending our voice in support of protecting youth, and we hope you will too! \nTo read the letter and add your name, visit: https://lnkd.in/gw38BrEt",

        "description": "Parenting can be stressful. Parenting kids with special needs can be even more stressful, and it can cause anxiety, depression and marital problems. A mindfulness practice can help alleviate stress and prevent these problems. And it can make you a better parent.\n\nMindfulness is designed to help you notice your emotions and calm yourself down in stressful situations. It includes breathing exercises, guided meditations and taking a step back from difficult situations. These habits can give you the time and emotional space you need to solve problems at home.\n\nSometimes mindfulness means slowing things down. Being mindful means focusing on right now and not always rushing to get to the next thing. It means letting go of the idea that things need to be perfect. Or that you need to be the perfect parent.\n\nPart of being a good parent is learning to dial back your own stress. Studies show that the biggest source of stress for kids is their parents\u2019 stress! So, parents who are less stressed make kids less stressed.\n\nIn stressful situations, your calm response will help your kids calm down too. They see that you\u2019re not falling apart. You\u2019re in control and that makes them feel safe.\n\nMindfulness doesn\u2019t have to be a big deal. It can be as simple as making one small change to the morning routine. It can mean giving your full attention to your kid in the moment. It can mean being kind to yourself. And that can make all the difference in the world.\n\nMore from the Child Mind Institute:\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/eaCTXfY",

        "description": "Parents who are the main caregivers for kids with special needs can be at risk for burnout, especially if they don\u2019t have enough support themselves. Symptoms of burnout include anxiety, depression, feeling tired and feeling cut off from other people.\n\nCaring for a child with a developmental or mental health disorder can put a big strain on your marriage or relationship. There can be also be physical risks from the constant stress of taking care of a special needs child. Physical risks from constant stress include things like heart disease, diabetes and cancer.\n\nTo avoid burnout, it\u2019s important for parents to take care of their own needs. That includes getting enough sleep and exercise, drinking enough water and spending time away from your child. Parents sometimes feel like they have to do everything by themselves, but getting help from other people is crucial. Support groups, spending time with friends and even just making time for fun activities on your own can all help.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have family you can rely on or money to hire babysitters, something called \u201crespite care\u201d can help. Respite care provides temporary help so you can take a break from constant caregiving.\n\nThis is where an organization called Access to Respite Care and Help (ARCH) comes in. Their website is: https://archrespite.org/ The ARCH website helps parents find respite care near them and ways to pay for it. It also has a guide for parents called ABCs of Respite: A Consumer\u2019s Guide for Family Caregivers.\n\nRead more:\nhttps://lnkd.in/gmWtwWX",

        "description": "By the time they\u2019re in middle school, kids are often eager to go on social media apps like Instagram, TikTok and WhatsApp to share things with their friends. But parents are wary because social media can be harmful to kids\u2019 self-esteem. And kids who post impulsively can create serious problems for themselves.\n\nWhile some experts and parental groups recommend waiting until kids are at least in the eighth grade to let them have access to social media, others note that it really depends on your child\u2019s maturity level. But experts agree that when you do allow access to social media, it\u2019s important to monitor what kids are posting on it. They recommend having your child\u2019s password as a condition of allowing them access to the app, and regularly discussing what they\u2019re posting. The goal is to help them learn the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of posting rather than hoping they\u2019ll figure out what\u2019s appropriate and what\u2019s not.\n\nFortunately, TikTok and other popular apps now offer parental controls that can limit how much time kids can spend, control privacy settings and turn off comments and direct messaging. There are apps that enable kids to create fun videos without sharing them with a broad audience. There are also tools like Bark that parents can use to monitor and limit kids\u2019 exposure on not only social media apps but YouTube, email, texting, TV and movies. (For details, see the full story below.)\n\nAnd for kids who are struggling with mental health issues like depression, experts recommend extra caution as social media algorithms tend to serve kids content that reflects their mood, and can perpetuate negative feelings.\n\nRead more from the Child Mind Institute: https://lnkd.in/e_BMay9m",

This nearly $20,000 planning grant will fund the development of a mental wellness curriculum, to help educators understand the mental wellness benefits of human-animal interactions and integrate concepts from our PAWS Therapy Dog Program into the classroom.\n\nThank you to both foundations for supporting our work and helping us make a difference! ?\n\n\n#TheChrisCenter #TherapyDogs #MentalWellness  #teenmentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #teenwellness #mentalhealthsupport #mindfulness #PAWSTheapyTeam #chriscenterpaws #therapydog #animaltherapy #dogtherapy #LathamFoundation #MCCOY #MarionCountyCommissiononYouth",

Look up the people who represent you at https://lnkd.in/gMQTry7b\n\n2. Local journalists are important to keep up with what\u2019s happening. Find & follow trustworthy local news sources. One we recommend is Chalkbeat Indiana at https://lnkd.in/gj2qn2HK\n\n3. If there is an issue important to you, write or call your legislator. Rip the bandage off by making that initial contact because it will only get easier afterward so you can do it more often. https://lnkd.in/g7-jsWjA\n\n4. Register for Youth Day at the Statehouse at https://lnkd.in/gTiXcCnB on February 17! Or, plan another time to visit the Indiana Statehouse to see what happens while our legislators are in session.\n\n5. Subscribe to MCCOY\u2019s Statehouse Sound-Off newsletter, where we bring you weekly updates about the legislation being discussed that impacts youth, families, & those who support them. https://lnkd.in/gCJSRxP8",

SNAP benefits don't change in the summer, when kids are home and have a much more difficult time accessing summer meal sites and other programs to fill the gaps usually met by school breakfast, lunch, snacks, and suppers. \n\nThis year, Governor Braun has decided not to participate in this program, that brought more than $70 million in federal funding to low income Hoosier families. This shortsighted move will stretch families' grocery budget even further, and cause kids to miss meals this summer; not a recipe to make Indiana healthier. Contact Governor Braun TODAY to tell him to restore funding for the SUN Bucks federal summer food service program so that kids in Indiana can have increased access to healthy foods over the summer.\n\nContact the governor: https://lnkd.in/gh_eFd97\n\nLearn more: Feeding Indiana's Hungry, Inc.",

Amendment #19 removes a current requirement that teacher preparation programs provide instruction to teacher candidates on \u201cevidence based social [and] emotional learning classroom practices\u201d that align with the state\u2019s SEL competencies. Amendment 32 will remove behavioral supports in Indiana classrooms and removes \"social, emotional, and behavioral functioning\" from the state's definition of \"school psychology.\"\n\nThese amendments were added without public testimony and the bill is now on its way to the full House chamber for further review.\n\nPlease take one minute to take action NOW and let your House representative know that you oppose these amendments to HB1002 to ensure educators receive the training they need to best serve students and that students receive the supports they need to succeed in school and beyond.\n\nTAKE ACTION NOW: https://lnkd.in/g9HE9R9N",

        "description": "In the summer of 2024, more than 600,000 Hoosier kids received $120 in benefits to help with their families' grocery bills. SNAP benefits don't change in the summer, when kids are home and have a much more difficult time accessing summer meal sites and other programs to fill the gaps usually met by school breakfast, lunch, snacks, and suppers. \n\nThis year, Governor Braun has decided not to participate in this program, that brought more than $70 million in federal funding to low income Hoosier families. This shortsighted move will stretch families' grocery budget even further, and cause kids to miss meals this summer; not a recipe to make Indiana healthier. Contact Governor Braun TODAY to tell him to restore funding for the SUN Bucks federal summer food service program so that kids in Indiana can have increased access to healthy foods over the summer.\n\nContact the governor: https://lnkd.in/gh_eFd97\n\nLearn more: Feeding Indiana's Hungry, Inc.",
