These are the start of some no-till garden beds! \n\nWhy Choose No-Till Beds Over Traditional Tilling?\n\nTilling the soil to plant can stir up dormant weed seeds and disrupt the delicate soil environment that nature is creating. No till beds utilize cardboard, well aged compost, and mulch to smother weeds and create a nutrient rich environment for new plants. It takes a whole season for the ingredients to break down, but the waiting can be worth it. We plan to use our new beds to create pocket prairies along the wellness trail in 2026!",

These are the start of some no-till garden beds! \n\nWhy Choose No-Till Beds Over Traditional Tilling?\n\nTilling the soil to plant can stir up dormant weed seeds and disrupt the delicate soil environment that nature is creating. No till beds utilize cardboard, well aged compost, and mulch to smother weeds and create a nutrient rich environment for new plants. It takes a whole season for the ingredients to break down, but the waiting can be worth it. We plan to use our new beds to create pocket prairies along the wellness trail in 2026!",

She also has a big heart and always asks how everyone is doing, who someone new is, and where a team member is if they aren't there that day. She also knows every Disney song and will proudly sing the best lines when we play music in class! It's an honor to teach and learn from Erin and her class is always a bright part of the day!\"\n\nWhen she is not at the farm, you might find Erin enjoying one of her favorite hobbies, bowling! She also scuba dives and is an excellent swimmer. But above all, there is one thing Erin wishes everyone knew about her: she can be really silly!\n\nWhether she is reaching her goals in the arena or zooming around in her orange power chair, Erin is a joyful reminder that determination can help us overcome even the toughest challenges, while still being silly along the way.\nLearn more about Erin, and see her, for her at: https://lnkd.in/gJB3JxxF",

A big shout-out to our staff and volunteers who care for the garden and ensure it is a safe space for all creatures.\n\nSightings like this reaffirm our commitment to conservation. By placing our land in a conservation easement with the Land Conservancy of McHenry County in 2014, we have ensured that these 40 acres will remain protected for pollinators, wildlife, and our community for generations to come.\n\nThe rusty-patched bumblebee was listed as a federally endangered species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2017. \n\n#EndangeredSpecies",

Now at 44, she continues to ride in our Adaptive Riding program, with the same joy and determination.\nOver the past year, she has made big strides in strength and communication, even returning to trotting again during her lessons. Her instructor Haley shared:\n\n\u201cI have loved watching Leah get stronger over the past year! She is strong enough to stay centered and balanced enough that we have been able to trot again during lessons! Leah has also been talking more, letting the leader know the color of the next pole or cone and even letting us know who is singing next in The Lion King! I'm excited that the weather is getting nice again, because she loves to ride outside and steer Harry over the tracks!\"\n\nDespite the frustration of not always being able to express herself verbally, it is the kindness and love that Leah receives that keeps her moving to new heights. Like her favorite Disney princesses, Leah carries a magic all her own - a spirit that speaks louder than words ever could.\n\nLearn more about Leah, and see her, for her at: https://lnkd.in/deHYFJQA",

        "description": "March is Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month, and this year's theme, \"We're Here All Year,\" says it all.\n\nIndividuals with developmental disabilities are not just part of our community one month out of the year; they are the community, every single day.\n\nWhen individuals with developmental disabilities are given the space to grow, connect, and contribute, the results simply speak for themselves. At the farm, we witness this every day in our programs. Through their unique abilities, they bring creativity, insight, resilience, and joy\u2014 not only to our farm but to the entire community.\n\nAwareness is NOT just a month-long campaign. It is an ongoing commitment to ensuring our spaces, programs, and mindsets are inclusive all year-round. It means recognizing that social-emotional learning, connection, and support are not extras\u2026 they are essentials. \n\nBecause when everyone is empowered to reach their full potential, we all thrive. \ud83d\udc9a",

Additionally, things can be hidden inside them so they provide a purposeful way to engage with fine motor skills in the arena \u2013 opening/closing doors, pulling things out and utilizing those objects in their lesson such as balls to throw in the basketball hoop, grooming tools to learn about, bean bags to throw etc.\n\nThank you, Lauren and Denise! \ud83d\udc9a",
