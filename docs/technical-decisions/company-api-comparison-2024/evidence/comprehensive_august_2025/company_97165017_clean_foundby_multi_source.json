I spent time with our partners at VigilanteX, who are helping bring AI into the physical world.\n\nCody Gross used to build cars at Tesla. Now he is building hardware that gives AI eyes. Watching him and Aaron Wallace work reminded me that the best innovation happens when people who have built real things start solving new problems. \n\nThey do not overthink. They just build.\n\nThe most powerful part of this partnership is not the technology. It is the mindset. When a customer brings an impossible problem, they don\u2019t look for reasons it cannot work. They roll up their sleeves and figure it out.\n\nThat is what it takes to bring AI into the real world. People who care deeply, think practically, and are not afraid to get their hands dirty.\n\nEvery time I leave days like this, I feel grounded. This is why I love building for the physical world. It keeps you honest. It keeps you learning. And it reminds you that progress is built one solved problem at a time.\n\nBuilt in America. Built to last. Built for the physical world.",

I spent time with our partners at VigilanteX, who are helping bring AI into the physical world.\n\nCody Gross used to build cars at Tesla. Now he is building hardware that gives AI eyes. Watching him and Aaron Wallace work reminded me that the best innovation happens when people who have built real things start solving new problems. \n\nThey do not overthink. They just build.\n\nThe most powerful part of this partnership is not the technology. It is the mindset. When a customer brings an impossible problem, they don\u2019t look for reasons it cannot work. They roll up their sleeves and figure it out.\n\nThat is what it takes to bring AI into the real world. People who care deeply, think practically, and are not afraid to get their hands dirty.\n\nEvery time I leave days like this, I feel grounded. This is why I love building for the physical world. It keeps you honest. It keeps you learning. And it reminds you that progress is built one solved problem at a time.\n\nBuilt in America. Built to last. Built for the physical world.",

        "description": "Construction theft isn\u2019t just a nuisance - it\u2019s a billion dollar crisis.\n\u00a0\nEvery year, job sites across the U.S. lose an estimated $1 billion to theft. From heavy machinery to essential tools and high-value materials like copper and lumber, nothing is safe. Shockingly, 85% of these thefts go unreported, and only a fraction of stolen equipment is ever recovered.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the kicker: many sites still lack basic security measures, like cameras.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about stolen property - it\u2019s about delays, safety risks, and increased costs that ultimately impact every stakeholder in the construction process.\n\nIf you're in the construction industry, what are you seeing on your sites? Have you implemented successful strategies to combat this?\nLet\u2019s start the conversation. \ud83d\udd12\ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\n\u00a0\n#ConstructionSafety #TheftPrevention #JobsiteSecurity #IndustryInsight",

        "description": "The security guard of 2025 is part human, part Silicon\n\nAI headlines fixate on 15 Million white-collar roles, yet the next frontier is where code meets concrete. Nowhere is that clearer than in physical security.\n\nVisit a construction site, big-box lot, or substation today and you\u2019ll still see a lone guard pacing, a wall of monitors flickering in a back room, and a radio that crackles only after something goes wrong. The U.S. employs 1.3 Million private guards in this reactive model.\n\nNow fast-forward to 2025. The security guard is flanked by an always-awake AI partner: cameras that don\u2019t just record, but reason; software that doesn\u2019t just alert, but engages and deters in real-time; and a digital command center that tracks every feed, policy and response playbook in real-time.\n\nAt Spot AI we call this blended force the AI Security Guard. This hybrid model is eclipsing yesterday\u2019s \u201cboots-only\u201d approach.\n\nThis has many benefits, particularly for large operators with a large location footprint.\n1. Multiply your workforce: Get more coverage with AI that doesn\u2019t get distracted or fatigued and can analyze every frame from 100s of camera concurrently.\n2. Re-value talent: Humans shift from passive watching to high-judgement tasks: engaging customers, coordinating law enforcement, resolving edge cases.\n3.Feed the boardroom with data: Every incident, near miss, and false alarm rolls into a unified dataset that informs staffing, insurance, and CapEx decisions.\n\nThe impact is tangible. Across 50+ sites Spot AI has deployed with our partner VigilanteX, the human-AI team surfaced and resolved 600+ safety and security events within the first quarter of deployment\u2014events that would have otherwise drained profit or shut down operations.\n\nThe security guard of 2025 is the blueprint for how AI will elevate every blue-collar role: augment the human, weaponize the data, and turn a cost centre into a source of strategic advantage. The world of Physical AI is here.",
