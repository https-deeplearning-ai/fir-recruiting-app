    "description": "Across Europe, healthcare providers lose hours every day to fragmented documentation\u2014handwritten notes, scanned PDFs, dictations, disconnected IT systems. The result: burnout, missed revenue, and patients feeling like they\u2019re asked the same question three times.\n\nAiomics changes this. Our AI-driven co-pilot captures every clinical detail\u2014speech, handwriting, digital notes\u2014and validates it in real time with a human-in-the-loop process. Interactive checklists surface missing information before the patient leaves, and audit-ready records flow straight back into existing systems. Built for GDPR, MDR, and the EU AI Act from day one, Aiomics makes documentation complete, compliant, and instantly usable.\n\nWe don\u2019t replace EHRs\u2014we make them better. From admission and discharge reports to insurer forms, from therapist briefings to patient-friendly letters, Aiomics turns paperwork from a burden into an asset. For providers, that means fewer errors, faster reimbursements, and\u2014most importantly\u2014more time at the bedside.\n\nOur mission: to empower healthcare professionals by removing administrative burdens and elevating their decision-making with trusted AI guidance\u2014so they can reconnect with why they chose this vocation in the first place \ufffc.\n\nWho we are:\nAiomics is co-founded by Dr. Sven Jungmann, a physician with frontline experience of administrative overload; Dr. Nikita Tarasov, a physicist and data scientist; and a lawyer [to be announced soon] who scaled one of Europe\u2019s largest digitally enabled hospitality companies. Together, we unite empathy, technical mastery, and regulatory expertise to build the trusted co-pilot for Europe\u2019s healthcare providers.",

Our goal is not just to cut admin\u2014it\u2019s to turn fragmented inputs into reliable, coded, audit\u2011ready data that supports better decisions across care and operations. We're not another scribe company, we're orchestrating data along the care journey beyond speech-to-text.\n\nWe\u2019re now shipping a hospital\u2011grade data\u2011quality layer that captures documents (printed and digital), handwriting, and speech in one validated workflow (with human\u2011in\u2011the\u2011loop), flags gaps in real time, and feeds structured outputs back into existing systems and deploys AI assistants to take away most of the annoying documentation work that none of our users ever wanted to do in the first place.\n\nWe\u2019re proud to be backed by institutional investors who truly understand healthcare and impact: Vorwerk Ventures, Calm/Storm, Norrsken Evolve, and rule30. \n\nAfter years as an operator, funder, and advisor in this field, our founder and CEO Dr. Sven Jungmann learned to value professional investors who actually understand healthcare and impact. There are too many trend surfers trying to import playbooks from unrelated industries. The teams behind our VCs are different\u2014thoughtful, domain\u2011literate, and constructive. We can only recommend them to other health\u2011tech founders.\n\nDeep thanks also to our angels: Konstantin Othmer, Nicolas Weber, Markus Wild, Christian Macht, Eddy Moosavi Pour, Steffen P Walz, and Bertram Duerr (and two more who prefer not to be named). You came in when things were still uncertain. This means the world and makes a huge difference.\n\nWe have big plans for Europe\u2014more on what we\u2019re rolling out next very soon.\n Handelsblatt covered the story today; link in the first comment.\n\n#healthtech #AI #hospitals #medtech #compliance #Europe #startups #Aiomics",

Nurses fill in the same information twice. Patients are asked the same question three times. Critical details get buried in PDFs. Meanwhile, staff shortages are at crisis levels, and burnout is driving talent out of healthcare.\n\nWe\u2019re here to change that.\n\nAt Aiomics, we capture and structure every important detail \u2014 from speech, handwriting, scans, or digital forms \u2014 so it\u2019s validated, coded, and ready to use in real time. We then deploy customisable AI assistants to take care of most soul draining tasks done manually by healthcare workers today. That means more time for care, fewer errors, faster reimbursements, and a safer, more human-centered healthcare system.\n\nYou\u2019d join a highly capable, low-ego team:\n\ud83e\ude7a A doctor with 10+ years in digital health and frontline clinical work\n\ud83e\uddee A physicist/data scientist with deep AI experience\n\u2696\ufe0f A lawyer who scaled a major tech company across Europe\n\ud83d\ude80 A product manager who worked for some of the best known health tech companies\n\ud83d\udcbb A top-notch software team with serious healthcare domain expertise\n\nWe\u2019re backed by leading healthcare & impact investors and work with some of Europe\u2019s most respected hospitals and research partners.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for someone who can:\n\u2013 Turn deep, multilingual UX research into designs that work in real clinics with real constraints\n\u2013 Move seamlessly between qualitative insights and quantitative validation \u2014 designing experiments, not just interfaces\n\u2013 Anticipate the regulatory and reimbursement realities that shape healthcare products\n\u2013 Craft AI-first, multimodal interactions (voice, handwriting, text, sensors) that feel natural and safe for users\n\u2013 Help us deliver on our early product promises fast, without compromising quality or trust\n\nIn your first 6\u201312 months, you might:\n\u2013 Create the machine\u2013human interaction blueprint that will define how our AI platform feels for years to come\n\u2013 Work directly with clinicians, nurses, therapists, and patients to design workflows that instantly save time and reduce burnout\n\u2013 Shape prototypes that make investors lean in \u2014 and make frontline staff say \u201cFinally, someone truly understands me\u201d\n\u2013 Prove that great design can thrive even under the strictest compliance rules\n\nThis isn\u2019t for everyone. Healthcare is complex, slow to change, and deeply regulated. But if you thrive where stakes are high, details matter, and the impact is real \u2014 you\u2019ll probably do the most meaningful work of your career here.\n\nLet\u2019s fix the way healthcare works, one interaction at a time.\n\n#hiring #ux #ui #designforimpact #digitalhealth #AI #multimodal #healthtech #aiomics #startupjobs",

No competing projects\u2014just one product, built right.\n\nOur team: 5 core members from different countries, speaking 9 languages collectively. I'm a doctor-turned-founder, bringing healthcare expertise to technical decisions. We reason from first principles, move fast, remove roadblocks efficiently, and build solid foundations\u2014no shortcuts on quality.\n\nRequirements: \n\u2022 Work authorization in Germany \n\u2022 Drive to transform healthcare through technology\n\u2022 German language skills valuable (other European languages also great) \n\nWe prefer warm introductions\u2014no recruiters please.

        "description": "Two startup reality checks from our journey:\nFirst: Everyone talks about building solutions with end users, but in healthcare, getting genuine access to clinical teams who can dedicate time to co-creation is incredibly challenging.\n\nSecond: German hospitals have a reputation for being slow to adopt new technologies. Just a few months ago, we couldn't have imagined we'd be spending most of our time building directly with hospital teams.\n\nBut something has shifted. Healthcare organizations are now actively seeking innovation partners, and MEDICLIN under Dr. Christian Dohmen-Griesenbach's leadership is pioneering this change.\n\nWhat makes this partnership remarkable is the depth of collaboration. Linda Pistor, Dr. Dimitrios Artemis, Prof. Dr. Philipp H\u00fcllemann, Dr. Max Holger Warnke, Dr. Florian Weber, and their colleagues aren't just stakeholders providing occasional feedback. They're opening up their workflows, sharing their daily  challenges with documentation, and actively shaping how our infrastructure evolves.\n\nWe're learning from the field what rehabilitation physicians need during admissions, how nurses navigate between systems, what information therapists actually need for treatment planning, and what legally mandated compliance tasks are keeping staff away from meaningful patient interactions. This isn't theoretical user research \u2013 it's building alongside the people who know exactly where technology can make the biggest difference.\n\nThe readiness for change we're witnessing at MEDICLIN signals something bigger: German healthcare is ready to pick up significant pace in digital transformation.\n\nMore insights from this collaboration coming soon.\n\n#StartupLessons #HealthTech #GermanHealthcare #DigitalTransformation",

Ziel ist es, diese Daten f\u00fcr eine intelligente Weiterverarbeitung verf\u00fcgbar zu machen: schneller, nachvollziehbarer, nutzbar f\u00fcr Patientenversorgung und Entscheidungsunterst\u00fctzung und Entlastung. Und nat\u00fcrlich folgt dieses Projekt einer Gesamtstrategie.\n\n\ud83e\udd1d Besonders wichtig:\nDieses Projekt entsteht nicht top-down, sondern wird aus der klinischen Praxis heraus gestaltet \u2013 gemeinsam mit \u00c4rzten, Therapeuten, Pflegekr\u00e4ften, Qualit\u00e4tsmanagern und Kaufleuten.

This recognition formally classifies us as a \"young innovative company\" within the German startup ecosystem.\n\nWhat is the BAFA INVEST Zuschuss?\nFor those unfamiliar with this program, it represents a strategic initiative by the German government to stimulate investment in innovative early-stage companies. The program functions as a de facto government endorsement of a startup's innovation potential and business model viability.\n\nThe Significance Beyond Financial Benefits\nThis approval process involves an independent evaluation of our company conducted by federal authorities.\n\nThis designation carries three key implications:\n\n1. External Validation: It provides independent verification of our innovation claims and business model from government experts who evaluate hundreds of companies annually.\n2. Risk Mitigation for Investors: The program offers private investors a 15% reimbursement on their investment and a 25% reimbursement on their exit sum, effectively improving the risk-return profile of investing in our company.\n3. Ecosystem Recognition: It positions us within Germany's formal innovation framework, potentially opening doors to additional innovation-focused resources, partnerships, and networks.\n\nWe see this milestone not merely as a financial incentive mechanism, but as validation of our team's hard work and our strategic direction. And we're pleased to be able to sweeten the deal for our ever so supportive investors, many of which have been an integral part of Dr. Sven Jungmann's previous journey(s). \n\nWe're grateful for this recognition and look forward to delivering on the innovative potential that this designation acknowledges.\n\n#Innovation #StartupGrowth #GermanTech #BAFA #aiomics",

Because healthcare professionals deserve honest partners who understand that behind every document is a patient waiting for care.\n\nFor our early partners and other forward-thinking organizations already working with us: thank you for trusting us to be part of your digital transformation journey. Your insights have shaped not just our technology, but how we communicate our mission.\n\nWe invite you to explore the new site and share your thoughts.

        "description": "Two startup reality checks from our journey:\nFirst: Everyone talks about building solutions with end users, but in healthcare, getting genuine access to clinical teams who can dedicate time to co-creation is incredibly challenging.\n\nSecond: German hospitals have a reputation for being slow to adopt new technologies. Just a few months ago, we couldn't have imagined we'd be spending most of our time building directly with hospital teams.\n\nBut something has shifted. Healthcare organizations are now actively seeking innovation partners, and MEDICLIN under Dr. Christian Dohmen-Griesenbach's leadership is pioneering this change.\n\nWhat makes this partnership remarkable is the depth of collaboration. Linda Pistor, Dr. Dimitrios Artemis, Prof. Dr. Philipp H\u00fcllemann, Dr. Max Holger Warnke, Dr. Florian Weber, and their colleagues aren't just stakeholders providing occasional feedback. They're opening up their workflows, sharing their daily  challenges with documentation, and actively shaping how our infrastructure evolves.\n\nWe're learning from the field what rehabilitation physicians need during admissions, how nurses navigate between systems, what information therapists actually need for treatment planning, and what legally mandated compliance tasks are keeping staff away from meaningful patient interactions. This isn't theoretical user research \u2013 it's building alongside the people who know exactly where technology can make the biggest difference.\n\nThe readiness for change we're witnessing at MEDICLIN signals something bigger: German healthcare is ready to pick up significant pace in digital transformation.\n\nMore insights from this collaboration coming soon.\n\n#StartupLessons #HealthTech #GermanHealthcare #DigitalTransformation",

Ein passender Anlass, um \u00fcber strukturelle Erneuerung im Gesundheitswesen nachzudenken.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Der aktuelle Interview-Beitrag mit dem Arzt und KI-Experten Dr. Sven Jungmann im FOCUS zur Rolle von KI in der Medizin bringt zentrale Gedanken auf den Punkt:\n\n\u2022 KI ist kein Ersatz, sondern ein Werkzeug, um \u00e4rztliches Denken zu erweitern.\n\u2022 Der Einstieg gelingt \u00fcber pragmatische Automatisierungen \u2013 etwa in der Dokumentation und Prozessstruktur.\n\u2022 Die Grundlage bleibt: saubere, vielf\u00e4ltige und vernetzte Daten.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/ehksfPtC\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Genau hier setzen wir auch bei #MEDICLIN gemeinsam mit Sven in einem zentralen Projekt an. Dort befassen wir uns mit der automatisierten Strukturierung gro\u00dfer Mengen klinischer Informationen \u2013 aus Vorsystemen, von Papier und aus unstrukturierten Formaten. Ziel ist es, diese Daten f\u00fcr eine intelligente Weiterverarbeitung verf\u00fcgbar zu machen: schneller, nachvollziehbarer, nutzbar f\u00fcr Patientenversorgung und Entscheidungsunterst\u00fctzung und Entlastung. Und nat\u00fcrlich folgt dieses Projekt einer Gesamtstrategie.\n\n\ud83e\udd1d Besonders wichtig:\nDieses Projekt entsteht nicht top-down, sondern wird aus der klinischen Praxis heraus gestaltet \u2013 gemeinsam mit \u00c4rzten, Therapeuten, Pflegekr\u00e4ften, Qualit\u00e4tsmanagern und Kaufleuten. Die digitale Transformation wird dadurch konkreter, anschlussf\u00e4higer und nachhaltiger.

This recognition formally classifies us as a \"young innovative company\" within the German startup ecosystem.\n\nWhat is the BAFA INVEST Zuschuss?\nFor those unfamiliar with this program, it represents a strategic initiative by the German government to stimulate investment in innovative early-stage companies. The program functions as a de facto government endorsement of a startup's innovation potential and business model viability.\n\nThe Significance Beyond Financial Benefits\nThis approval process involves an independent evaluation of our company conducted by federal authorities.\n\nThis designation carries three key implications:\n\n1. External Validation: It provides independent verification of our innovation claims and business model from government experts who evaluate hundreds of companies annually.\n2. Risk Mitigation for Investors: The program offers private investors a 15% reimbursement on their investment and a 25% reimbursement on their exit sum, effectively improving the risk-return profile of investing in our company.\n3. Ecosystem Recognition: It positions us within Germany's formal innovation framework, potentially opening doors to additional innovation-focused resources, partnerships, and networks.\n\nWe see this milestone not merely as a financial incentive mechanism, but as validation of our team's hard work and our strategic direction. And we're pleased to be able to sweeten the deal for our ever so supportive investors, many of which have been an integral part of Dr. Sven Jungmann's previous journey(s). \n\nWe're grateful for this recognition and look forward to delivering on the innovative potential that this designation acknowledges.\n\n#Innovation #StartupGrowth #GermanTech #BAFA #aiomics",

Because healthcare professionals deserve honest partners who understand that behind every document is a patient waiting for care.\n\nFor our early partners and other forward-thinking organizations already working with us: thank you for trusting us to be part of your digital transformation journey. Your insights have shaped not just our technology, but how we communicate our mission.\n\nWe invite you to explore the new site and share your thoughts. Whether you're wrestling with documentation challenges in your own organization or simply interested in how AI can meaningfully improve healthcare operations, we'd love to hear from you.\n\nVisit us at www.aiomics.io and let's continue the conversation about building better healthcare infrastructure for Europe.\n\n#HealthcareInnovation #DigitalHealth #MedTech #HealthIT #AIinHealthcare",

        "description": "Two startup reality checks from our journey:\nFirst: Everyone talks about building solutions with end users, but in healthcare, getting genuine access to clinical teams who can dedicate time to co-creation is incredibly challenging.\n\nSecond: German hospitals have a reputation for being slow to adopt new technologies. Just a few months ago, we couldn't have imagined we'd be spending most of our time building directly with hospital teams.\n\nBut something has shifted. Healthcare organizations are now actively seeking innovation partners, and MEDICLIN under Dr. Christian Dohmen-Griesenbach's leadership is pioneering this change.\n\nWhat makes this partnership remarkable is the depth of collaboration. Linda Pistor, Dr. Dimitrios Artemis, Prof. Dr. Philipp H\u00fcllemann, Dr. Max Holger Warnke, Dr. Florian Weber, and their colleagues aren't just stakeholders providing occasional feedback. They're opening up their workflows, sharing their daily  challenges with documentation, and actively shaping how our infrastructure evolves.\n\nWe're learning from the field what rehabilitation physicians need during admissions, how nurses navigate between systems, what information therapists actually need for treatment planning, and what legally mandated compliance tasks are keeping staff away from meaningful patient interactions. This isn't theoretical user research \u2013 it's building alongside the people who know exactly where technology can make the biggest difference.\n\nThe readiness for change we're witnessing at MEDICLIN signals something bigger: German healthcare is ready to pick up significant pace in digital transformation.\n\nMore insights from this collaboration coming soon.\n\n#StartupLessons #HealthTech #GermanHealthcare #DigitalTransformation",

Dort befassen wir uns mit der automatisierten Strukturierung gro\u00dfer Mengen klinischer Informationen \u2013 aus Vorsystemen, von Papier und aus unstrukturierten Formaten. Ziel ist es, diese Daten f\u00fcr eine intelligente Weiterverarbeitung verf\u00fcgbar zu machen: schneller, nachvollziehbarer, nutzbar f\u00fcr Patientenversorgung und Entscheidungsunterst\u00fctzung und Entlastung. Und nat\u00fcrlich folgt dieses Projekt einer Gesamtstrategie.\n\n\ud83e\udd1d Besonders wichtig:\nDieses Projekt entsteht nicht top-down, sondern wird aus der klinischen Praxis heraus gestaltet \u2013 gemeinsam mit \u00c4rzten, Therapeuten, Pflegekr\u00e4ften, Qualit\u00e4tsmanagern und Kaufleuten.

This recognition formally classifies us as a \"young innovative company\" within the German startup ecosystem.\n\nWhat is the BAFA INVEST Zuschuss?\nFor those unfamiliar with this program, it represents a strategic initiative by the German government to stimulate investment in innovative early-stage companies. The program functions as a de facto government endorsement of a startup's innovation potential and business model viability.\n\nThe Significance Beyond Financial Benefits\nThis approval process involves an independent evaluation of our company conducted by federal authorities.\n\nThis designation carries three key implications:\n\n1. External Validation: It provides independent verification of our innovation claims and business model from government experts who evaluate hundreds of companies annually.\n2. Risk Mitigation for Investors: The program offers private investors a 15% reimbursement on their investment and a 25% reimbursement on their exit sum, effectively improving the risk-return profile of investing in our company.\n3. Ecosystem Recognition: It positions us within Germany's formal innovation framework, potentially opening doors to additional innovation-focused resources, partnerships, and networks.\n\nWe see this milestone not merely as a financial incentive mechanism, but as validation of our team's hard work and our strategic direction. And we're pleased to be able to sweeten the deal for our ever so supportive investors, many of which have been an integral part of Dr. Sven Jungmann's previous journey(s). \n\nWe're grateful for this recognition and look forward to delivering on the innovative potential that this designation acknowledges.\n\n#Innovation #StartupGrowth #GermanTech #BAFA #aiomics",

This recognition formally classifies us as a \"young innovative company\" within the German startup ecosystem.\n\nWhat is the BAFA INVEST Zuschuss?\nFor those unfamiliar with this program, it represents a strategic initiative by the German government to stimulate investment in innovative early-stage companies. The program functions as a de facto government endorsement of a startup's innovation potential and business model viability.\n\nThe Significance Beyond Financial Benefits\nThis approval process involves an independent evaluation of our company conducted by federal authorities.\n\nThis designation carries three key implications:\n\n1. External Validation: It provides independent verification of our innovation claims and business model from government experts who evaluate hundreds of companies annually.\n2. Risk Mitigation for Investors: The program offers private investors a 15% reimbursement on their investment and a 25% reimbursement on their exit sum, effectively improving the risk-return profile of investing in our company.\n3. Ecosystem Recognition: It positions us within Germany's formal innovation framework, potentially opening doors to additional innovation-focused resources, partnerships, and networks.\n\nWe see this milestone not merely as a financial incentive mechanism, but as validation of our team's hard work and our strategic direction. And we're pleased to be able to sweeten the deal for our ever so supportive investors, many of which have been an integral part of Dr. Sven Jungmann's previous journey(s). \n\nWe're grateful for this recognition and look forward to delivering on the innovative potential that this designation acknowledges.\n\n#Innovation #StartupGrowth #GermanTech #BAFA #aiomics",
