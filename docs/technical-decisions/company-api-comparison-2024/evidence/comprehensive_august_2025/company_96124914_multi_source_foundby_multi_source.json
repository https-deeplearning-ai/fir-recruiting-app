Through the vertical sea ranch, we will bring a steady, dependable source of local seafood to both local and international markets - bringing with it a revitalization of critical maritime expertise, equipment, and capital to ensure a scalable food supply chain and ecosystem that is resilient in the face of climate change and its impact on our Pacific Northwest coasts.",

Over the past decade, a warm water blob off the U.S. West Coast has caused sea urchins to overgraze the #kelp forests, leading to a massive population boom of urchins, the collapse of kelp ecosystems, and the rise of countless \u201czombie\u201d sea urchins\u2014urchins that prevent the kelp from regrowing without dying themselves.\n\nWhy should we care? Because this phenomenon is happening everywhere\u2014whether it\u2019s invasive species or extreme #weather events, #ecosystems are collapsing, and without smart intervention, they won\u2019t recover. OoNee's solution is to harvest the sea urchins threatening the remaining kelp, fatten them up, and sell them to the growing market for high-end #seafood. What can we learn from this approach and apply to other ecosystems that are out of balance?\n\nThis is part of the Regenerative Aquaculture series supported by The Nest Family Office.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gQdGQYUv",

Over the past decade, a warm water blob off the U.S. West Coast has caused sea urchins to overgraze the #kelp forests, leading to a massive population boom of urchins, the collapse of kelp ecosystems, and the rise of countless \u201czombie\u201d sea urchins\u2014urchins that prevent the kelp from regrowing without dying themselves.\n\nWhy should we care? Because this phenomenon is happening everywhere\u2014whether it\u2019s invasive species or extreme #weather events, #ecosystems are collapsing, and without smart intervention, they won\u2019t recover. OoNee's solution is to harvest the sea urchins threatening the remaining kelp, fatten them up, and sell them to the growing market for high-end #seafood.
