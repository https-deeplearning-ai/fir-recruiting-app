Over the past decade, a warm water blob off the U.S. West Coast has caused sea urchins to overgraze the #kelp forests, leading to a massive population boom of urchins, the collapse of kelp ecosystems, and the rise of countless \u201czombie\u201d sea urchins\u2014urchins that prevent the kelp from regrowing without dying themselves.\n\nWhy should we care? Because this phenomenon is happening everywhere\u2014whether it\u2019s invasive species or extreme #weather events, #ecosystems are collapsing, and without smart intervention, they won\u2019t recover. OoNee's solution is to harvest the sea urchins threatening the remaining kelp, fatten them up, and sell them to the growing market for high-end #seafood. What can we learn from this approach and apply to other ecosystems that are out of balance?\n\nThis is part of the Regenerative Aquaculture series supported by The Nest Family Office.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gQdGQYUv",

Over the past decade, a warm water blob off the U.S. West Coast has caused sea urchins to overgraze the #kelp forests, leading to a massive population boom of urchins, the collapse of kelp ecosystems, and the rise of countless \u201czombie\u201d sea urchins\u2014urchins that prevent the kelp from regrowing without dying themselves.\n\nWhy should we care? Because this phenomenon is happening everywhere\u2014whether it\u2019s invasive species or extreme #weather events, #ecosystems are collapsing, and without smart intervention, they won\u2019t recover. OoNee's solution is to harvest the sea urchins threatening the remaining kelp, fatten them up, and sell them to the growing market for high-end #seafood. What can we learn from this approach and apply to other ecosystems that are out of balance?\n\nThis is part of the Regenerative Aquaculture series supported by The Nest Family Office.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gQdGQYUv",

Over the past decade, a warm water blob off the U.S. West Coast has caused sea urchins to overgraze the #kelp forests, leading to a massive population boom of urchins, the collapse of kelp ecosystems, and the rise of countless \u201czombie\u201d sea urchins\u2014urchins that prevent the kelp from regrowing without dying themselves.\n\nWhy should we care? Because this phenomenon is happening everywhere\u2014whether it\u2019s invasive species or extreme #weather events, #ecosystems are collapsing, and without smart intervention, they won\u2019t recover. OoNee's solution is to harvest the sea urchins threatening the remaining kelp, fatten them up, and sell them to the growing market for high-end #seafood. What can we learn from this approach and apply to other ecosystems that are out of balance?\n\nThis is part of the Regenerative Aquaculture series supported by The Nest Family Office.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gQdGQYUv",

Over the past decade, a warm water blob off the U.S. West Coast has caused sea urchins to overgraze the #kelp forests, leading to a massive population boom of urchins, the collapse of kelp ecosystems, and the rise of countless \u201czombie\u201d sea urchins\u2014urchins that prevent the kelp from regrowing without dying themselves.\n\nWhy should we care? Because this phenomenon is happening everywhere\u2014whether it\u2019s invasive species or extreme #weather events, #ecosystems are collapsing, and without smart intervention, they won\u2019t recover. OoNee's solution is to harvest the sea urchins threatening the remaining kelp, fatten them up, and sell them to the growing market for high-end #seafood. What can we learn from this approach and apply to other ecosystems that are out of balance?\n\nThis is part of the Regenerative Aquaculture series supported by The Nest Family Office.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gQdGQYUv",

Over the past decade, a warm water blob off the U.S. West Coast has caused sea urchins to overgraze the #kelp forests, leading to a massive population boom of urchins, the collapse of kelp ecosystems, and the rise of countless \u201czombie\u201d sea urchins\u2014urchins that prevent the kelp from regrowing without dying themselves.\n\nWhy should we care? Because this phenomenon is happening everywhere\u2014whether it\u2019s invasive species or extreme #weather events, #ecosystems are collapsing, and without smart intervention, they won\u2019t recover. OoNee's solution is to harvest the sea urchins threatening the remaining kelp, fatten them up, and sell them to the growing market for high-end #seafood. What can we learn from this approach and apply to other ecosystems that are out of balance?\n\nThis is part of the Regenerative Aquaculture series supported by The Nest Family Office.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gQdGQYUv",

The disease has devastated sea star populations along the Pacific Coast since 2013, including over 90% of sunflower sea stars \u2014 a key predator of sea urchins.\n\nThe loss of these predators contributed to unchecked sea urchin grazing, accelerating the decline of kelp forests across the region.\n\nAt OoNee, our work centers on restoring balance to this system. By harvesting and fattening undernourished urchins, we reduce pressure on kelp beds while building a regenerative, high-value seafood product.\n\nThis discovery is an important step forward for marine science and ecosystem recovery. It opens the door for targeted sea star restoration \u2014 which, paired with efforts like ours, can help stabilize coastal food webs and support long-term kelp recovery.\n\nWe\u2019re encouraged by the progress and remain committed to regenerative aquaculture solutions that benefit both ocean ecosystems and coastal economies.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gnxey2BA\n\n#regenerativeaquaculture #marineecology #kelprestoration #bluefoods #oceanhealth",

Over the past decade, a warm water blob off the U.S. West Coast has caused sea urchins to overgraze the #kelp forests, leading to a massive population boom of urchins, the collapse of kelp ecosystems, and the rise of countless \u201czombie\u201d sea urchins\u2014urchins that prevent the kelp from regrowing without dying themselves.\n\nWhy should we care? Because this phenomenon is happening everywhere\u2014whether it\u2019s invasive species or extreme #weather events, #ecosystems are collapsing, and without smart intervention, they won\u2019t recover. OoNee's solution is to harvest the sea urchins threatening the remaining kelp, fatten them up, and sell them to the growing market for high-end #seafood.

Over the past decade, a warm water blob off the U.S. West Coast has caused sea urchins to overgraze the #kelp forests, leading to a massive population boom of urchins, the collapse of kelp ecosystems, and the rise of countless \u201czombie\u201d sea urchins\u2014urchins that prevent the kelp from regrowing without dying themselves.\n\nWhy should we care? Because this phenomenon is happening everywhere\u2014whether it\u2019s invasive species or extreme #weather events, #ecosystems are collapsing, and without smart intervention, they won\u2019t recover. OoNee's solution is to harvest the sea urchins threatening the remaining kelp, fatten them up, and sell them to the growing market for high-end #seafood. What can we learn from this approach and apply to other ecosystems that are out of balance?\n\nThis is part of the Regenerative Aquaculture series supported by The Nest Family Office.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gQdGQYUv",

The disease has devastated sea star populations along the Pacific Coast since 2013, including over 90% of sunflower sea stars \u2014 a key predator of sea urchins.\n\nThe loss of these predators contributed to unchecked sea urchin grazing, accelerating the decline of kelp forests across the region.\n\nAt OoNee, our work centers on restoring balance to this system. By harvesting and fattening undernourished urchins, we reduce pressure on kelp beds while building a regenerative, high-value seafood product.\n\nThis discovery is an important step forward for marine science and ecosystem recovery. It opens the door for targeted sea star restoration \u2014 which, paired with efforts like ours, can help stabilize coastal food webs and support long-term kelp recovery.\n\nWe\u2019re encouraged by the progress and remain committed to regenerative aquaculture solutions that benefit both ocean ecosystems and coastal economies.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gnxey2BA\n\n#regenerativeaquaculture #marineecology #kelprestoration #bluefoods #oceanhealth",

Over the past decade, a warm water blob off the U.S. West Coast has caused sea urchins to overgraze the #kelp forests, leading to a massive population boom of urchins, the collapse of kelp ecosystems, and the rise of countless \u201czombie\u201d sea urchins\u2014urchins that prevent the kelp from regrowing without dying themselves.\n\nWhy should we care? Because this phenomenon is happening everywhere\u2014whether it\u2019s invasive species or extreme #weather events, #ecosystems are collapsing, and without smart intervention, they won\u2019t recover. OoNee's solution is to harvest the sea urchins threatening the remaining kelp, fatten them up, and sell them to the growing market for high-end #seafood. What can we learn from this approach and apply to other ecosystems that are out of balance?\n\nThis is part of the Regenerative Aquaculture series supported by The Nest Family Office.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gQdGQYUv",

The disease has devastated sea star populations along the Pacific Coast since 2013, including over 90% of sunflower sea stars \u2014 a key predator of sea urchins.\n\nThe loss of these predators contributed to unchecked sea urchin grazing, accelerating the decline of kelp forests across the region.\n\nAt OoNee, our work centers on restoring balance to this system. By harvesting and fattening undernourished urchins, we reduce pressure on kelp beds while building a regenerative, high-value seafood product.\n\nThis discovery is an important step forward for marine science and ecosystem recovery. It opens the door for targeted sea star restoration \u2014 which, paired with efforts like ours, can help stabilize coastal food webs and support long-term kelp recovery.\n\nWe\u2019re encouraged by the progress and remain committed to regenerative aquaculture solutions that benefit both ocean ecosystems and coastal economies.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gnxey2BA\n\n#regenerativeaquaculture #marineecology #kelprestoration #bluefoods #oceanhealth",
